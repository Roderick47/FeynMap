# FeynMap Roadmap

## Phase 0 — V3 foundation

- [x] Canonical language-neutral semantic graph
- [x] Evidence/provenance model
- [x] Confidence tiers
- [x] Adapter interfaces and registry
- [x] Initial Python V2 compatibility bridge
- [x] Grounded query API
- [x] Claim validation
- [x] Migration-readiness model
- [x] Migration-unit partitioning
- [x] Modern package/CLI structure

## Phase 1 — Separate Python from frameworks ✅

- [x] Replace the V3 Python/V2 bridge with a framework-neutral Python AST adapter
- [x] Extract Python modules, classes, functions, methods, imports, calls, inheritance, annotations, and async/await facts without framework knowledge
- [x] Add a first-class module/import graph
- [x] Move Django classification into `DjangoAdapter`
- [x] Move Flask classification into `FlaskAdapter`
- [x] Move FastAPI classification into `FastAPIAdapter`
- [x] Auto-detect framework adapters independently of language detection
- [x] Support framework-free analysis with `--framework none`
- [x] Preserve the V2 framework-aware pipeline only as an explicit legacy compatibility path
- [x] Add regression tests proving generic Python facts exist before framework enrichment

### Python semantic hardening backlog

These improve Python depth but are no longer architectural blockers.

- [ ] explicit variable/state read, write, and mutation edges
- [ ] richer type-resolution and inferred type constraints
- [ ] package/dependency manifest normalization
- [ ] dynamic dispatch confidence
- [ ] decorator/metaclass/plugin semantics beyond framework adapters

## Phase 1.5 — Repository orchestration & integration resolution ✅

FeynMap now treats a repository as a heterogeneous software system rather than choosing one dominant language.

- [x] Detect and run every applicable language adapter in one repository scan
- [x] Merge language graphs under one repository root while preserving node identity/evidence
- [x] Apply multiple framework adapters independently where applicable
- [x] Add framework-neutral HTML analysis
- [x] Add initial framework-neutral JavaScript analysis
- [x] Map multiple JavaScript functions/classes/methods and local calls
- [x] Resolve Python/framework template rendering → HTML
- [x] Resolve HTML script loading → JavaScript modules
- [x] Resolve HTML event handlers → JavaScript functions
- [x] Resolve JavaScript HTTP requests → Python framework endpoints
- [x] Add framework-neutral Python HTTP/process/file/database/FFI boundary extraction
- [x] Add JavaScript WebSocket/process/file/Electron/deep-link/native-bridge boundary extraction
- [x] Add a language-neutral integration-contract model
- [x] Resolve non-web channels: subprocess/CLI, queues, files, FFI, IPC, databases, sockets, deep links/app routes
- [x] Preserve unresolved/ambiguous boundaries instead of guessing
- [x] Track integration resolution at individual-contract granularity
- [x] Add mixed-language and non-web regression tests

### Integration hardening backlog

- [ ] embedded-language regions (inline `<script>`, Vue/Svelte single-file components, templated JS/CSS)
- [ ] richer JavaScript parsing via Tree-sitter/TypeScript compiler APIs
- [ ] route-prefix composition (`include_router`, nested routers, mounted apps, reverse routing)
- [ ] CSS/assets and bundler-generated dependency graphs
- [ ] protocol schemas (OpenAPI, protobuf/gRPC, GraphQL schemas)
- [ ] container/process topology from Docker/Compose/Kubernetes
- [ ] build-system orchestration (Make, Gradle, Cargo build scripts, npm scripts, CI workflows)

## Phase 2 — AI grounding service

- [ ] Persistent graph cache with incremental updates
- [ ] Repository snapshot/hash identity
- [ ] MCP server
- [ ] `get_symbol`, `find_callers`, `find_dependencies`, `trace_path`
- [ ] `validate_claim`, `change_impact`
- [ ] token-budgeted context bundles

## Phase 3 — More language adapters

Suggested order based on reuse and migration value:

1. TypeScript
2. Rust
3. Java
4. C / C++
5. C#
6. Go
7. Swift / Kotlin for native/mobile application graphs
8. Shell and build/config languages where they materially affect execution topology

JavaScript is now present as the first non-Python implementation and should later be upgraded with a parser-backed adapter. Framework adapters can then be added independently: Express/NestJS, Spring, ASP.NET, Axum/Actix, Android/iOS frameworks, etc.

## Phase 4 — Multi-source truth

- [ ] runtime trace ingestion
- [ ] test/coverage evidence
- [ ] git co-change evidence
- [ ] build/compiler/type-checker diagnostics
- [ ] dynamic dispatch confidence
- [ ] evidence conflict handling

## Phase 5 — Rust migration engine

- [ ] source type constraints
- [ ] mutation graph
- [ ] ownership/lifetime evidence
- [ ] side-effect and I/O boundaries
- [ ] async/concurrency boundaries
- [ ] dependency/crate mapping
- [ ] target architecture planner
- [ ] partial Python → Rust migration
- [ ] FastAPI/Flask service → Axum migration
- [ ] compile/test/behavior verification loop
- [ ] TypeScript/Node → Rust
- [ ] C/C++ → Rust

## Phase 6 — Ecosystem

- [ ] stable adapter SDK
- [ ] plugin discovery
- [ ] versioned ontology extensions
- [ ] IDE integrations
- [ ] CI/change-review integration
- [ ] graph storage backends for very large repositories
